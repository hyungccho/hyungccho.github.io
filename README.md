#Jekyll & Github pages

Check out the page! http://hyungccho.github.io

This is a small personal blog mainly for putting out technical information
about coding, and hopefully sometimes about my experience here in San Francisco
with App Academy. I'll be using Jekyll and Github pages, along with 'So Simple Theme'
by designer slash illustrator Michael Rose.

I'll be trying to update this blog as frequently as possible, but given my current schedule
that might end up not being too often. If anyone reading this wants to chat, you can e-mail me
at hyungchulcho93@gmail.com!
