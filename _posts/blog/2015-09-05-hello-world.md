I'm now two weeks into my 12-week coding bootcamp at App Academy, and the experience thus far has been amazing. I'm loving all
the new additions to the curriculum to make it more difficult, and meeting everyone involved has been nothing but fantastic. We keep
a required blog for App Academy through Tumblr, but I've decided to try and start my own technical blog on coding.

I'll be using GitHub pages along with Jekyll to upload posts and update my blog. I'd just found out about this feature, and I have to say
that I'm impressed. The implementation is pretty seamless, and straight forward enough for a beginner like me to start with little to no
trouble.

If you're interested in chatting, whether it's about my App Academy experience, or coding, or anything... Don't hesitate to contact me!
You can reach me through e-mail: hyungchulcho93@gmail.com!

##Onward, matey!
