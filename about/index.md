If you had a pair of fresh Nike's, a coach training you, and your family cheering for you, could you outrun me? You might, but I'll
never believe it.

My mentality is simple. I might be slower, I might not be as equipped, I might not have your support, but that won't ever stop me
from trying. It's ridiculous how often we get ahead of ourselves, and stop ourselves from losing or failing. The true failure
lies in never having attempted it. How can anyone go about living their lives without failing? Accept it, learn from it, just to fail
again. With that said, here's a couple little things about me:

##My name is Hyung.

* I identify as an Asian American.
* I've lived in the states since I was three.
* I'm currently 22 years old.
* I'm currently attending App Academy.
* I love sports.
* I have a loving girlfriend, Esther.
* I have an adorable puppy named Mimi.
